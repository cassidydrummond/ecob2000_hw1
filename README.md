### Econ B2000, MA Econometrics

### Kevin R Foster, CCNY

*This first HW has complicated multiple due dates for different parts,
see details below. In general HW are due after each class, where I
usually give you night-owls the option of working until 8am the next
morning.*

*Each student should submit a separate assignment, even if it is an
identical computer file to the rest of your study group. I’ll put a HW1
channel on Slack and you should put a link to your github there. When
submitting assignments, please include your name and the assignment
number as part of the filename. Please write the names of your study
group members at the beginning of your homework.*

1.  What are the names of the people in your study group?
2.  Work on the Hawkes stats review - you must complete the diagnostic
    test by end of the day Friday Sept 24.
3.  *this is due before class* During class on Thursday Sept 2, we’ll do
    experiments on sequences of random numbers. I gave out dice in first
    class, for you to play with sanding, filing, heating, drilling,
    gluing, squeezing or whatever to see if you can adjust which numbers
    come up. Before class, you should have done about 20 experiments
    where you roll the dice and record whether the result was a 6 or
    not.
4.  Open up R (on laptop or cloud). Replicate the commands given in the
    lecture notes *R Basics for Lecture 1* to do some simple stats on
    the PUMS-NY data. Those notes request that you find average ages for
    men and women after accounting for the top-coding. Tell me something
    else interesting, that you learned from the data, for example about
    educational attainments in different neighborhoods in the city. Are
    there surprises for you?
5.  Differences in means can be complicated. Find the mean return on
    SP500 index (choose a time period). What is the mean return on days
    when the previous day’s return was positive? When the previous 2
    days were positive? Negative? Now read about “hot hands fallacy” and
    tell if you think that helps investment strategy. (You might start
    with [this

    and read the papers referenced.)

*The dice example is from Andrew Gelman’s book on Teaching Stats.*
